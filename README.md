**OBD2_CanBus** is a lightweight yet powerful ESP32 compatible library that enables direct communication with vehicles using the **Can Bus**.

This library is designed for microcontrollers such as **ESP32**, and similar platforms. It allows your device to communicate directly with a vehicle that uses the **Can Bus**.  
If you're curious about which types of data are supported, you can find a full list of features below.

## ‚ùì Does Your Vehicle Support Can Bus?

Before using this library, it's important to confirm whether your vehicle supports the **Can Bus** protocol.

Can Bus vehicles typically have **Pin 6 and Pin 14** on the OBD-II connector connected.
If your vehicle‚Äôs OBD-II connector has **Pins 7 connected**, it uses the **K-Line** protocol instead of Can Bus.

‚úÖ **Pin 6 and 14 (CAN bus)**: Your vehicle uses CAN ‚Äî this library will work.  
‚ùå **Pin 7 (K-Line)**: Your vehicle likely supports ISO 9141 or ISO 14230 (KWP2000) ‚Äî consider a different library.  


### Example photos of OBD2 Connector

In the first image, the OBD2 socket includes pin 7, which indicates it operates using the K-Line protocol.
In the second image, pins 6 and 14 are present, meaning it uses the CAN Bus protocol.

### üìä Typical Data Rates

Each protocol has its own timing characteristics, which affect how many responses you can expect per second when reading data from the ECU. The values below reflect **actual performance measurements** based on this library‚Äôs real-world testing.

| Protocol     | Average Responses per Second |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 250KBPS      |  Not Tested                   |
| 500KBPS      | ~100 responses/sec            |

> üîé Note: Tese values represent average conditions based on real-world testing. The actual throughput can vary depending on the ECU‚Äôs internal processing time, the specific data being requested (e.g. PID type), and system latency.
